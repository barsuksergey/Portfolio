*Instagram offers an option to download your data in settings* <br>
This sends an archive with all images/messages/stats etc to your email address.
I have broken down into 2 scripts to make sure that all messages were moved properply to one dir, from where each of them is later parsed using the second script.
My goal was to extract all emails, so I have used regex to catch emails in messages.
